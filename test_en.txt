A chatbot script is an original document which outlines sequences of conversational messages based on user intention and selections.

What To Consider Before You Start Writing
The script writing process starts with an understanding of the business process.

Where is additional support required?
What questions can a bot or artificial intelligence answer to support user experience?
How can a bot filter MQLs towards SQLs?
Chatbot execution starts with:

Finding the logical question and answer needs within the buyer journey.
Crafting the narrative first.
Building the bot second.
Crafting the narrative first is perhaps the most important chatbot consideration. Trying to fiddle in your bot platform adding and editing questions will just lead to frustration. Write the script for your buyer journey, leading MQLs to SQLs, and build the bot sequences second.
